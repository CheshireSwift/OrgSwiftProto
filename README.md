# OrgSwiftProto
Organising, Swiftly HTML Prototype

## Running
Open index.html.

That's it.

## Development
It's just static HTML/CSS. This is by design. This is purely for demonstrating new features at a semi-visual, conceptual level, before they're implemented in the actual product.

Any "functionality" is just implemented as a new page showing the result of the interaction.

[devd](https://github.com/cortesi/devd) is pretty helpful as a minimal livereload server while editing. `devd -ol .` will open the site and livereload whatever page you're on as you save changes.

## Release
Merge changes into the gh-pages branch. It'll show up on the repository website (see above re: 'just static HTML/CSS').
